Continents of Eld

Caillard
  As described in "Political Entities - Caillard Continent - Primary"

Selentis
  A land of strange unusual politics and even more unusual cultures. Selentis was ruled and ultimately sundered by two ancient empires: Bel’Tarath and Dracosia. Ruled by aristocrats of tieflings and dragonborn respectively, the war between the two led to their mutual destruction, with the people that once comprised them building new kingdoms from the scattered remains.

Angrost
  A volatile land marked by an abundance of leylines, the soil itself thrums with magic. Many small kingdoms and governments expand and position themselves over strategic resources as much of Angrost is covered in harsh wilderness. Many dangers and legends regarding untapped riches abound.

Eór nan Fuír
  A green and white land possessed of innate natural beauty. Civilization is few and far between, the Tuatha being the most numerous. Unusual demigods and other powerful beings are worshiped here, and some of the continent overlaps closely with the Feywild.

The Dark Continent
  Located at the cap of the world, it is a realm of ice and misery. Giants stride the wastes, great ferocious beasts hunt the gray skies and stormy seas, darkness covers most.
