Down Time Framework

Projects:
  Projects (learning a new skill, creating simple or complex non-magical working, item enchantment)
    Minor
      1-5 days depending on complexity (a mundane item)
    Moderate
      2-4 weeks depending on complexity (learning a trade/picking up a new proficiency)
    Major
      1 month to 1 year (Enchanting a magic item, a major town construction)
  When crafting/doing a project the DM will set the base time based on the project following the guidelines above per classification. Cost in materials (and any special materials needed) will be determined case-by-case. A “day” of construction is considered to be 8 uninterrupted hours devoted to the task. Additional craftsmen can help reduce the task completion time (with certain projects requiring Skilled only) by up to half.

Creating Potions, Poisons and other Alchemical Substances:
  Brewing  potions and scribing scrolls are a more common application of magical study and require less of an investment to do so. To engage in alchemy a character must:
    Be proficient in an applicable tool
    Herbalism kit (potions)
    Poisoner’s kit (poisons)
    Alchemist’s tools (works as both herbalism and poisoner’s kit and also allows alchemical crafting)
    Have the materials required (half the market cost’s worth in materials, plus any specific reagents as stipulated by the DM)
    Invest the time
Once this criteria is met the character makes a check using the tool. The result will be adjudicated by the DM (and for very simple potions, the roll may be foregone altogether).
  Alchemy Crafting Times
    Common – 1 day
    Uncommon – 3 days
    Rare – 7 days
    Very rare – 1 month
  The times listed can be reduced by utilizing skilled assistance. For every additional craftsman that contributes their skills may reduce the time taken by half (rounded up) to a minimum of one day.

To scribe a scroll a character must:
  Be proficient in Arcana (arcane) or Religion (divine) or Nature (natural)
  Be capable of casting the spell desired (it must be on their class list be prepared; it will be expended in crafting)
  Have the materials required, including any material costs required by the spell itself (see the following table for material costs)
  Invest the time

  Scribing Material Costs:
    Scrolls require specifically treated magic inks and paper to craft:
    Cantrips – 10gp per spell level
    1st through 3rd – 50gp per spell level
    4th through 6th – 500gp per spell level
    7th through 9th – 5000gp per spell level
